  Vim Lua GDB thingy
 ====================

Small Lua script to toggle GDB breakpoints using the 'sign' feature in Vim to
be used externally. To install, put the hvlgdb.vim file anywhere and put
something like the following in your vimrc:

    source /path/to/hvlgdb.vim
    map tc :call HVLGDB_clear()<CR>
    map tf :call HVLGDB_set_filenames()<CR>
    map tl :call HVLGDB_load()<CR>
    map tn :call HVLGDB_next_breakpoint()<CR>
    map ts :call HVLGDB_save()<CR>
    map tt :call HVLGDB_toggle_breakpoint()<CR>
    map tw :call HVLGDB_write_breakpoints()<CR>

clear............: Clears all breakpoints in the current file.
set_filenames....: Sets filenames for saving sessions and the GDB breakpoint
                 list.
load.............: Loads breakpoints from previous session.
next_breakpoint..: Jumps to the next breakpoint in the file.
save.............: Saves breakpoints for future session.
toggle_breakpoint: Toggles breakpoint on the current line in the file.
write_breakpoints: Writes breakpoints in a GDB friendly format.

To start GDB with the list of breakpoints written to the default filename:

    gdb -x .hvlgdb.breakpoints ./buggy_crap

This will never integrate GDB inside of Vim as that is a messy minefield.
