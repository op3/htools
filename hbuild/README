hbuild - Building tools
-----------------------

A collection of tools and snippets to make GNU make even more powerable.


build_dir.mk
------------
Creates a nice build directory name.

include build_dir.mk
# BUILD_DIR now has the nice name.


config_cc.mk
------------
Various ways to configure compilation.

include config_cc.mk
%.o: %.c
	$(CONFIG_CC)
$(CONFIG_CC): Makefile


hconf.sh
---------
Shell script to auto configure source code with preprocessor branches
identified by "if defined(HCONF_*). The branches are tested top-down, so
fallback branches should be organized towards the bottom.

my_header.h:
	#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
	#define MY_HEADER_H
	#if defined(HCONF_1)
	# define PRIz "d"
	#elif defined(HCONF_THAT_OTHER_WAY)
	# defined PRIz "z"
	#endif
	#define HCONF_TEST printf("%"PRIz, (size_t)0)
	#endif
sh hconf.sh -v my_build_dir my_header.h

my_build_dir/hconf/my_header.h now defines the most appropriate branch and
includes the given header. But this can be done also for sauce code:

my_sauce.c:
	#include <hconf/my_sauce.c.h>
	#if defined(HCONF_OH_RLY)
	# include <exotic/system/header.h>
	#elif defined(HCONF_YA_RLY)
	# include <another/system/header.h>
	#endif
sh hconf.sh -v my_build_dir my_sauce.c

my_build_dir/hconf/my_sauce.c.h now defines the most appropriate branch.
