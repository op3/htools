hutils - utility code
=====================

This is just a collection of useful little code snippets that I collect. It's
auto-configured with hconf in hgmake and tested with the htest unit testing
framework. First read htools/README, then call GNU make:
 $ make / gmake

To run the tests, htest must have been built. The root makefile does this in
the right order, so just call that.

In your own code, include whatever headers look like fun and link like this in
gcc:
include $(HTOOLS_PATH)/hgmake/build_dir.mk
-L$(HTOOLS_PATH)/hutils/$(BUILD_DIR) -lhutils
